                <p>The Kia EV9 is known as one of the fifteen electric vehicles that Kia is releasing by 2027. The Kia has detailed the EV9 as "refined boxiness." All with new design, like sharp edges, and triangular shapes. The car, no matter how high the shoulders are, also possess a low beltline for lower visibility. There's a likelihood that the headlights and taillights are both vertical with future Kia models. The prototype is possessing 21-inch wheels, with 19 inch and 20 inch options, with wheel inserts that come across the sharp-edges and square and triangular options on display towards the event that had been installed to the EV9.</p>

                <p>Kia has not yet had the opportunity to confirm the different features for the EV9, save for the battery, powertrain, capacity, range and even other dimensions, with an eight-inch wheelbase stretch. The tall and flat roofline works well with the second and third rows, all while the aerodynamics are quite important on electric vehicles, with a drag coefficient of 0.007.</p>

Additionally, there's a dash design that wraps over the doors with a calming sensation that closes in around you. As well as the headrest possessing mesh design on the front seats. Looking at the dashboard, you can tell there's a minimalist and horizontal appearance. All while, the screen extends from the 12.3 screens. One made for the gauge cluster and the other for infotainment. And between the two displays, there's a truly amazing HVAC readout in between.</p>

                <p>When noticing the changes, there's a variety of physical knobs and buttons that can provide all sorts of necessary controls and volume knobs, while a touch-sensitive controls allow for access between different menus. Kia wants to show that they can invest in a new generation of infotainment, but they'll most likely wait to show how involved they are in the brand-new system.</p>

                <p>Even if dimensions are a four-letter word in this case, the second-row itself is spacious enough while the third row holds plenty of legroom and headroom. Second-row seats are even rumored to swivel when facing the rear. As it stands right now, the EV9 will arrive in six or seven passenger variants, all while the uplevel models have power folding involved with the third row. </p>
